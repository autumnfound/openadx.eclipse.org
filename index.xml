      <description>The first open source project which will be contributed by the OpenADx Eclipse Working Group is now in the community review.
What is Eclipse Cloe? Eclipse Cloe is an enhanced middleware solution for closed-loop simulations, with a focus on functional software tests on system level. Cloe is used as a development tool for interactive and scripted workstation simulations, for code debugging, and for automated tests on servers. Cloe covers a central part of the verification and validation strategy, needed by all vendors in the field of Automated Driving.</description>

      <description>Date: 25th June 2019
Location: Filderhalle Leinfelden-Echterdingen (near Stuttgart airport)
We are happy to invite you to our first meeting about forming the Eclipse OpenADx Working Group.
This event will bring all interested parties together for information about the Eclipse Working Group idea. Everyone is invited! We will also discuss technical aspects and continue our open exchange.
Please see the OpenADx Working Group wiki page for more information. The meeting is organized by the Eclipse Foundation and Bosch as an Eclipse member, and will be held under the Eclipse Bylaws (Eclipse Bylaws, Industry Working Group Process, Eclipse Intellectual Property Policy, Eclipse Anti-Trust Policy).</description>

      <description>About Technologies Automated Driving (AD) is clustered into three equally important technology areas:
 In-vehicle technology Cloud technology (backend) Design, development, test and validation tools (tool chain)  OpenADx is currently focused on the AD tool chain. The goal is to accelerate AD development through open collaboration and open source.
OpenADx&amp;rsquo; vision is to ensure transparency and make the complex AD tool landscape more easily accessible for enterprise users.
Challenge AD is a complex challenge and therefore requires a multifaceted development process incorporating a variety of software tools.</description>

      <description>Autonomous driving (AD) is an extremely complex challenge with a complex development process, which is slowed at every turn by incompatibility between widely used development tools. The tools we already use in and of themselves are very good, but they do not work seamlessly with one another simply because they were never designed to work with each other. This is an industry-wide issue. It slows us all down in the race to automated driving.</description>

      <description>About The OpenADx working group will coordinate the development of Eclipse Foundation projects on the following topics:
 Implementation of interfaces between the development steps Implementation of common standards from other working groups (e.g. VDA Leitinitiative) Definition of an initial setup for fast implementation Ensures interoperability between development stages  Projects hosted by the Eclipse Foundation in the context of the OpenADx working group apply the Eclipse development process and best practices of openness, transparency and meritocracy.</description>
