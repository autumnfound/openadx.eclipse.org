      <description>The first open source project which will be contributed by the OpenADx Eclipse Working Group is now in the community review.
What is Eclipse Cloe? Eclipse Cloe is an enhanced middleware solution for closed-loop simulations, with a focus on functional software tests on system level. Cloe is used as a development tool for interactive and scripted workstation simulations, for code debugging, and for automated tests on servers. Cloe covers a central part of the verification and validation strategy, needed by all vendors in the field of Automated Driving.</description>

      <description>About Technologies Automated Driving (AD) is clustered into three equally important technology areas:
 In-vehicle technology Cloud technology (backend) Design, development, test and validation tools (tool chain)  OpenADx is currently focused on the AD tool chain. The goal is to accelerate AD development through open collaboration and open source.
OpenADx&amp;rsquo; vision is to ensure transparency and make the complex AD tool landscape more easily accessible for enterprise users.
Challenge AD is a complex challenge and therefore requires a multifaceted development process incorporating a variety of software tools.</description>

      <guid>https://openadx.eclipse.org/vision/</guid>
      <description>Autonomous driving (AD) is an extremely complex challenge with a complex development process, which is slowed at every turn by incompatibility between widely used development tools. The tools we already use in and of themselves are very good, but they do not work seamlessly with one another simply because they were never designed to work with each other. This is an industry-wide issue. It slows us all down in the race to automated driving.</description>
