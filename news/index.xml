Open Collaboration for safer Autonomous Mobility of the Future (Director&amp;rsquo;s Pick)
Work in the field of automated driving and autonomous mobility requires many multi-faceted processes incorporating a variety of software tools. In particular, any software that will be used in a vehicle must undergo rigorous testing, increasingly including vehicle and traffic simulation, as part of the verification and validation (V&amp;amp;V) strategy.
As of yet, there is no single tool to cover all simulation needs from the detailed level of the vehicle to the transportation system as a whole.</description>

      <description>The first open source project which will be contributed by the OpenADx Eclipse Working Group is now in the community review.
What is Eclipse Cloe? Eclipse Cloe is an enhanced middleware solution for closed-loop simulations, with a focus on functional software tests on system level. Cloe is used as a development tool for interactive and scripted workstation simulations, for code debugging, and for automated tests on servers. Cloe covers a central part of the verification and validation strategy, needed by all vendors in the field of Automated Driving.</description>
